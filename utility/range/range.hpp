// This forms part of the implicit utility library I originally wrote for part

// copied + pasted code and it grew more or less organically.
//
// This sub-library, /utility/range, forms a mostly lazy (and sometimes greedy)
// implementation of D-like ranges, which replace (and are better than) c++ 
// iterators.
